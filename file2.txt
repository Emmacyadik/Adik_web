I'm glad to say that I've earned the title of AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. What a magnificent way to end 2021. Many thanks to Azubi Africa for the fantastic opportunity, skills, and relationships made thus far during the 12-week AWS restart training program. For me, the certification is less essential than how deeply the training has affected my life and thinking. I've learned and mastered abilities in cloud computing, Linux, networking, security, troubleshooting, databases, and python programming that I knew nothing about before. The hands-on labs, which I enjoyed the most, provided me with a practical approach to handling real-world scenario challenges, and the soft skills sections were life-changing.
I'd like to thank my Azubi Africa pan African group buddies Toluwase Makanjuola, Albert Banda, Adetola Adeyemo MBA,ACIPM,PHRi,SPHRi, Hamza Sekiranda, Ebenezer Kuku, HÃ©ritier Cyubahiro Nzanana, Kangai M. Ruth Ogendi, Espoir Gaglo, Moses Anzagi e.t.c for your love, teamwork, and support throughout the training, as well as the amazing instructors Pauline Namwakira, Samuel Boame Asiedu, Cess Waithaka, Ajara Amadu, David Makafui Awanta, Lawrence Muema, Selina Adams, Linda Oyapi Asamoah, William J. Mukoyani, Flonny Saiwa for your motivation and encouragement. It is said that a thousand-mile trip begins with a single step. I hope to achieve much more.
